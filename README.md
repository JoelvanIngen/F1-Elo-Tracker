# F1-Elo-Tracker
In Formula One it is difficult to accurately compare skill between drivers, since both the pace difference between the drivers and between their cars are unknown.
A few years back I got the idea to rate drivers indirectly by comparing them against their teammate, and seeing how their teammate would score against other drivers when they were still driving for a different team.
I wrote some code as a proof of concept and forgot about the project.
This was until a while ago when I saw [this video by Mr V's Garage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U16a8tdrbII) and got inspired to pick up the project again.
